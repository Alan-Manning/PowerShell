# Windows PowerShell Profile

This is my powershell setup. Mainly serving as reference for myself.

This is using powershell from the Microsoft GitHub https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell

There is some other functions and aliases setup that are from christitus' article on pretty powershell https://christitus.com/pretty-powershell.

# On top of the base

## fzf

fzf command-line fuzzy finder is installed on my system https://github.com/junegunn/fzf. This is installed via chocolatey.

## PSFzf

I then have PSFzf which is a lightwight wrapper around fzf for powershell https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf. This was installed via the PowerShell Gallery. The setup for this is simply a keymap to lauch and setting tab completeion to be fzf not default.

## Oh My Posh

In terms of look i have oh-my-posh https://ohmyposh.dev/. This is a simple one line setup with the atomic theme.
