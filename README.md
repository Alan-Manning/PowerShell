This is my powershell setup. Mainly serving as reference for myself.

This is using powershell from the Microsoft GitHub https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell

I then have the fzf fuzzy finder installed on my system https://github.com/junegunn/fzf. This is installed via chocolatey.

Also i have PSFzf, A lightwight wrapper around fzf for powershell, https://github.com/kelleyma49/PSFzf. This was installed via the PowerShell Gallery. The setup for this is simply a keymap to lauch and setting tab completeion to be fzf not default.

In terms of look i have oh-my-posh https://ohmyposh.dev/. This is a simple one line setup with the atomic theme.

There is some other functions and aliases setup that are from christitus' article on pretty powershell https://christitus.com/pretty-powershell.
